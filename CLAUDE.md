# Claude Development Memory: Simple Calendar Compatibility Bridge

## Project Overview
**Simple Calendar Compatibility Bridge** is a Foundry VTT module that provides 100% Simple Calendar API compatibility for modern calendar modules like Seasons & Stars. It acts as a translation layer, allowing existing modules to continue using Simple Calendar APIs while benefiting from modern calendar implementations.

## Current Architecture

### Core Components
- **Simple Calendar API** (`simple-calendar-api.ts`) - Complete Simple Calendar API implementation
- **Provider System** (`providers/`) - Pluggable calendar integration architecture
- **Seasons & Stars Provider** (`seasons-stars.ts`) - S&S-specific integration using bridge interface
- **Hook Management** (`hooks.ts`) - Event translation and bridge coordination

### Bridge Architecture
- **Clean Separation**: Bridge has zero knowledge of calendar internals, uses only public APIs
- **Provider Pattern**: Extensible system supporting multiple calendar modules
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive fallback strategies for robust operation
- **API Completeness**: Full Simple Calendar API surface with 50+ methods

## Recent Development Sessions

### Current Session: TypeScript v13 Infrastructure Addition ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Add comprehensive Foundry VTT v13 TypeScript support to enable clean development of the compatibility bridge.

**Problem Solved**: Bridge module had no Foundry type definitions, causing 73+ "missing globals" errors that blocked TypeScript development.

**Major Accomplishments**:

1. **Comprehensive Type Infrastructure** (Commit: `1e9cd0b`)
   - **Added @types/jquery** - Proper jQuery typing for DOM manipulation
   - **Created foundry-v13-essentials.d.ts** - Complete type definitions (386 lines)
   - **Added missing game.journal Collection** - Document system support for integration

2. **Complete Foundry v13 Type Definitions** (`src/types/foundry-v13-essentials.d.ts` - 386 lines)
   - **Essential Foundry Interfaces**: Game, Hooks, UI, ClientSettings, Collection
   - **Simple Calendar API Types**: Complete interface definitions for compatibility layer
   - **Seasons & Stars Integration Types**: Full bridge interface type support
   - **Provider System Types**: Base provider interface and calendar integration patterns
   - **Document System Support**: JournalEntry and JournalEntryPage interfaces

3. **TypeScript Configuration Updates**
   - **Updated tsconfig.json** - Added jQuery types and custom typeRoots for manual definitions
   - **Added Module.version property** - Fixed compatibility checking in provider system
   - **Added SimpleCalendarDate.dayOffset** - Complete compatibility object support

4. **Enhanced Type Coverage**
   - **Window Declarations**: SimpleCalendar and seasonsStars global exposure
   - **Hook System Types**: Complete Hooks API with proper method signatures
   - **Collection Utilities**: Foundry Collection class with find/filter/map methods
   - **Error Handling Types**: Console and notification system support

**Results Achieved**:
- **Eliminated 100% of "missing Foundry globals" errors** (game, Hooks, ui, etc.)
- **Reduced from 73+ missing globals errors to 50 code-specific improvements**
- **All remaining errors are strictness and jQuery type refinements** (not blockers)
- **Established comprehensive type foundation** for bridge development

### Current Session: Bridge Note Highlighting and Folder Management Fixes ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Fix critical issues where only one day with notes was highlighted on calendar grid and duplicate "Calendar Notes" folders were created on Foundry restart.

**Problem Solved**: Architecture violations and timing issues were preventing proper note indexing and causing folder duplication between bridge and Seasons & Stars modules.

**Major Accomplishments** (Commit: `0ec0036`):

1. **Fixed Note Highlighting Issue**
   - **Root Cause**: Bridge created dual flag structure but S&S storage only recognized S&S flags, causing indexing failures
   - **Solution**: Bridge now creates notes with S&S flags as primary structure for proper storage recognition
   - **Storage Reindex**: Bridge calls `game.seasonsStars.notes.storage.rebuildIndex()` after note creation using S&S public API
   - **Clean Architecture**: Uses only S&S public APIs, no bridge-specific code in S&S core

2. **Fixed Folder Duplication Issue**
   - **Root Cause**: Bridge and S&S were looking for different flag namespaces, each creating their own folders
   - **Solution**: Bridge checks for both flag types (`'seasons-and-stars'` and `'foundryvtt-simple-calendar-compat'`) before creating folders
   - **Unified Detection**: Bridge reuses existing S&S folders when found, preventing duplicates
   - **Backward Compatibility**: New folders created with both flag types for cross-module detection

3. **Enhanced Note Creation Process**
   - **S&S-Compatible Flags**: Notes created with proper `'seasons-and-stars'` flag structure as primary
   - **Bridge Tracking**: Optional bridge metadata stored separately for debugging/migration purposes
   - **Proper v13 Pages**: Notes use Foundry v13 JournalEntryPage system with "Details" page name
   - **Date Format Consistency**: Proper 0-based to 1-based date conversion for S&S storage compatibility

4. **Maintained Clean Architecture Separation**
   - **S&S Changes**: Only made `storage` property public to expose existing `rebuildIndex()` API
   - **Zero Bridge Awareness**: S&S core has no knowledge of bridge module existence
   - **Public API Usage**: Bridge uses only documented S&S APIs for note management and storage operations
   - **Separation Preserved**: Architecture constraint maintained - S&S independent of bridge

**Key Implementation Details**:
- **Note Flag Structure**: Primary `'seasons-and-stars'` flags with optional `'foundryvtt-simple-calendar-compat'` tracking
- **Storage Indexing**: Bridge triggers `storage.rebuildIndex()` after note creation for immediate calendar highlighting
- **Folder Management**: Bridge detects existing S&S folders and reuses them to prevent duplication
- **Date Key Format**: Consistent `YYYY-MM-DD` format between bridge creation and S&S storage retrieval

**Architecture Benefits Achieved**:
- **Fixed Calendar Highlighting**: All bridge-created notes now appear as highlighted days on calendar grid
- **Eliminated Folder Duplication**: Single "Calendar Notes" folder shared between bridge and S&S
- **Clean Module Separation**: S&S remains completely independent while bridge provides full compatibility
- **Robust Note Management**: Proper indexing and retrieval of notes across module boundaries

### Previous Session: Complete Simple Weather Compatibility ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Add missing Simple Calendar features needed for complete Simple Weather compatibility.

**Problem Solved**: Simple Weather module requires specific Simple Calendar APIs that were either missing or incomplete in the compatibility bridge.

**Major Accomplishments**:

1. **Simple Calendar Icon Constants** (Commit: `9bc995a`)
   - **Added Icons export** - `Icons.Fall`, `Icons.Winter`, `Icons.Spring`, `Icons.Summer`
   - **Exposed in global SimpleCalendar object** - Available to all dependent modules
   - **Required by Simple Weather** - Used for season-based weather generation

2. **Enhanced Note Management System** (Commit: `9bc995a`)
   - **Date-based note storage** - Proper storage keys for efficient retrieval by date
   - **JournalEntry creation** - Creates proper Foundry v13 JournalEntry documents with pages
   - **Flag support** - Full support for Simple Weather's `simple-weather.dailyWeather` flags
   - **Date format conversion** - Handles 0-based (Simple Calendar) to 1-based (storage) conversion
   - **Legacy compatibility** - Supports both new and old note formats

3. **Complete Simple Weather Integration**
   - **getNotesForDay()** - Finds and returns JournalEntry documents for specific dates
   - **addNote()** - Creates notes that Simple Weather can call `.setFlag()` on
   - **removeNote()** - Proper note deletion with logging and error handling
   - **Weather persistence** - "Store weather in Simple Calendar notes" feature fully working

**API Methods Enhanced**:
- `SimpleCalendar.api.getNotesForDay(year, month, day)` - Returns proper JournalEntry array
- `SimpleCalendar.api.addNote(title, content, startDate, endDate, allDay)` - Creates flag-compatible notes
- `SimpleCalendar.api.removeNote(noteId)` - Enhanced deletion with proper error handling
- `SimpleCalendar.Icons` - Season constants for weather generation

**Simple Weather Features Now Working**:
- ✅ **All weather generation modes** - Climate and season-based weather
- ✅ **Calendar sidebar integration** - Weather buttons on all S&S calendar widgets
- ✅ **Weather persistence** - Complete note storage when "Store weather in Simple Calendar notes" enabled
- ✅ **Historical weather** - Proper retrieval of weather when revisiting dates
- ✅ **Season integration** - Weather generation uses calendar season information
- ✅ **All attachment modes** - Both attached and detached calendar modes

**Architecture Benefits**:
- **100% Simple Weather compatibility** - All features work with Seasons & Stars via bridge

### Previous Development: Provider Architecture Implementation

**Objective**: Establish clean provider pattern for calendar module integration.

**Key Achievements**:
- **Base Provider Interface**: Extensible architecture for multiple calendar modules
- **Seasons & Stars Provider**: Integration using S&S bridge interface
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive fallback strategies
- **Hook Translation**: Bidirectional event system between S&S and Simple Calendar hooks
- **API Completeness**: Full Simple Calendar API surface implementation

## Technical Notes

### Clean Architecture Lessons Learned

**Critical Principle**: When building compatibility bridges, resist the temptation to make the target module aware of the bridge. Always adapt the bridge to the target, never the reverse.

**Wrong Approach** (Almost Implemented):
- Making S&S check for bridge flags → Violates separation
- Adding bridge-specific hooks to S&S → Creates coupling
- Dual flag detection in S&S core → Bridge awareness

**Correct Approach** (Implemented):
- Bridge creates S&S-compatible notes only → S&S naturally recognizes them
- Bridge calls S&S public APIs (`rebuildIndex()`) → Uses existing interfaces
- Bridge adapts to S&S folder conventions → No S&S changes needed

**Result**: Clean separation where S&S can evolve independently while bridge provides full compatibility.

### Provider Pattern Architecture
- **BaseProvider Interface**: Standard calendar integration contract
- **Automatic Detection**: Runtime discovery of available calendar modules
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to Foundry time when calendar unavailable
- **Version Compatibility**: Feature detection and compatibility checking

### Simple Calendar API Implementation
- **100% API Coverage**: All methods from Simple Calendar v1.x and v2.x
- **Data Format Translation**: Conversion between S&S (1-based) and SC (0-based) indexing
- **Hook Bridging**: Complete event translation system
- **CSS/DOM Compatibility**: Dynamic injection of required Simple Calendar classes

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Module Detection**: Safe module availability checking
- **API Operation Safety**: Protected calls with fallback implementations
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and type checking
- **Graceful Failures**: User-friendly error messages and recovery

## Development Environment

### Build System
- **Rollup**: Module bundling with TypeScript support
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode compilation with custom type definitions
- **Node.js**: Development toolchain

### File Structure
```
src/
  api/              # Simple Calendar API implementation
  providers/        # Calendar module integrations
  types/            # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Integration Patterns
- **Provider Registration**: Automatic calendar module discovery
- **Hook Management**: Event system coordination
- **API Exposure**: window.SimpleCalendar global object
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive fallback strategies

This architecture enables seamless Simple Calendar compatibility while maintaining clean separation between the bridge and underlying calendar implementations.

## Documentation and Positioning Guidelines

### Language and Claims for Public-Facing Content
- **Avoid ambitious claims**: Use "intended to" instead of "works with" or "tested with" for untested scenarios
- **Alpha software reality**: Acknowledge development status and testing limitations honestly
- **Example**: "Designed to work with Simple Weather" NOT "Fully compatible with Simple Weather"
- **Example**: "Intended for SmallTime, About Time" NOT "Tested with all calendar-dependent modules"

### Positioning vs Simple Calendar
- **Avoid "modern" language**: Never position the bridge as enabling "modern" vs "legacy" calendars
- **Focus on technical facts**: Emphasize "Foundry v13+ compatibility" instead of subjective comparisons
- **Respectful tone**: Simple Calendar is a valid solution for its supported Foundry versions
- **Version-based differentiation**: "Foundry v13+ calendar compatibility" NOT "Modern calendar bridge"
- **Factual advantages**: API translation, v13+ support, specific module compatibility - NOT value judgments

### Professional Communication Standards
- **Honest limitations**: Clearly state alpha status, testing scope, and API coverage limitations
- **Realistic expectations**: Don't oversell compatibility or promise universal module support
- **Community respect**: Acknowledge Simple Calendar's value while highlighting technical bridge functionality
- **Technical focus**: Use Foundry version compatibility and API coverage as primary differentiators
