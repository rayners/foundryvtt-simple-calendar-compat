## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Automatically convert stored Simple Calendar world settings to Seasons & Stars format and register them when `seasons-stars:registerExternalCalendars` fires, including resilient defaults for missing month and weekday data.
- Expose a parse-time `SimpleCalendar` stub and register a compatibility module entry so dependent modules like Simple Weather or Item Piles can detect the API before their initialization hooks run.
- Mirror Simple Calendar DOM structure, CSS classes, and hook emissions on Seasons & Stars widgets so Simple Weather's attached mode and sidebar buttons render without Simple Calendar being installed.
- Notify users about calendar imports and continue registration even when malformed entries are skipped.
- Introduced comprehensive repository management assets: CODEOWNERS, SECURITY policy, release template, and Codecov configuration.
- Added GitHub workflows for CI, CodeQL scanning, release automation, semantic pull request validation, Discord release notifications, and stale issue management.

### Changed
- Initialize the compatibility bridge synchronously during the `seasons-stars:ready` hook so the Simple Calendar API, hook bridge, and widget integration are ready before downstream modules continue their setup.
- Upgraded the development toolchain to match Seasons & Stars: ESLint 9 flat config with `@rayners/foundry-dev-tools`, Prettier 3, Vitest 3, and refreshed TypeScript project configuration.
- Enabled Husky and lint-staged git hooks with expanded npm scripts for formatting, linting, testing, and build validation.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-06-06

### Fixed
- Fixed remaining weekday conversion errors in hook system and integration provider
- Completed weekday indexing fix across all code paths (hooks.ts, seasons-stars-integration.ts)
- All weekday conversions now correctly use 0-based indexing for full WFRP4e compatibility

### Technical Details
- Eliminated final instances of incorrect `weekday - 1` conversions in hook bridging
- Fixed weekday array access in integration provider display formatting
- Ensured consistent 0-based weekday handling across the entire bridge codebase

## [0.1.1] - 2025-06-06

### Fixed
- Fixed weekday conversion errors causing date offset issues in WFRP4e and other calendar systems
- Corrected weekday validation logic to properly handle 0-based weekday indexing
- Fixed array access issues when retrieving weekday names for display
- Eliminated double conversion of weekday values between Simple Calendar and Seasons & Stars formats

### Technical Details
- Both Simple Calendar and Seasons & Stars use 0-based weekdays (Sunday = 0), removing the need for +1/-1 conversions
- Updated validation checks from `>= 1` to `>= 0` for proper weekday range checking
- Fixed array indexing to use direct weekday values instead of `weekday - 1`

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-02

### Added
- Initial release of Simple Calendar Compatibility Bridge
- Complete Simple Calendar API implementation with 50+ methods
- Seasons & Stars provider integration
- Simple Weather full compatibility
- SmallTime integration support
- Bridge pattern architecture for extensible calendar module support
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback strategies
